1. There should be 4000 entries in the log (1000 from 4 different threads)

2. Entires in unsynced log (slog):
	- Number of entries is 4000
	  slog is 4000(4000)

	- Number of entries is 3800
	  slog is 3999(3800)

	- Number of entries is 3001
	  slog is 3006(3001)

	- Number of entries is 3052
	  slog is 3093(3052)

3. Entries in synced log (log):

	- Number of entries is 4000
	  log is 4000

	- Number of entries is 3800
	  log is 3800

	- Number of entries is 3001
	  log is 3001 

	- Number of entries is 3052
	  log is 3052 

4. From the observed results above, the synchronized log is not truly protected because when the 
threads are calling 'synchronized (this)', they are only synchronizing with their own specific 
threads. Therefore when two DIFFERENT threads are running at the same time, they are not synced 
with each other. Only if we were to run 2 Sleepy/Yappy threads would this synchronize properly
but since we run both Yappy and Sleepy threads, they are not synced and this results in the 
log not being properly protected even when appearing to be.
